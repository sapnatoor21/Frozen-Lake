The Frozen Lake Q-Learning project in Reinforcement Learning involves training an agent to navigate a slippery gridworld where it must reach a goal while avoiding holes. Using the Q-Learning algorithm, the agent updates state-action values through exploration and exploitation, learning to find the optimal path despite the environment's stochastic nature. The project focuses on balancing risks and rewards in uncertain conditions.
